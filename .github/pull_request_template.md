## Project Information

1. **Project Name:**

2. **Project URL:**

3. **Description:**

   _(Please provide a brief description of the project.)_

----

## Criteria

Please answer the following questions about the project you are submitting. This will help us determine whether it should be included in the Awesome Django list.

**Note:** If your project is only a few months old or has under 50 to 100 stars on GitHub, it may NOT meet the criteria for inclusion in the Awesome Django list. We recommend that you promote your project more and then consider submitting it when it has gained more visibility and community support.

**Additionally:** 🙅 We are not interested in Django Starter Kit projects. We might change our minds, but for now, these tend to be more similar than different. Every Django Starter Kit is awesome.

**Read the Room:** 👀 Before submitting, please take time to browse through the existing projects in the list. Get a sense of the quality, maturity, and types of projects we include. If your submission is primarily promotional or doesn't clearly benefit the broader Django community, it's probably not a good fit. We're looking for projects that solve real problems and have demonstrated value to the ecosystem.

👉 Please **read** and fill out **all five questions**. We reserve the right to close your pull request without feedback if you skip one or all of them.

1. **Is the project new?**
   - [ ] Yes
   - [ ] No

2. **How long has the project been maintained?**

   _(Please provide an approximate duration in months or years.)_

3. **How many releases has it had if it's a library or package?**

   _(Please provide the number of releases, or link to the project's release history.)_

4. **Are you the author, or are you submitting the project on behalf of a company?**
   - [ ] I am the author
   - [ ] I am submitting on behalf of a company
   - [ ] Other (please specify)
